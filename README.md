# pokedex

Welcome to the Pokedex project!

This is a command-line REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) application that lets you explore information about Pokémon right from your terminal. The Pokedex uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch all the data you need using HTTP GET requests.

If you're not familiar with Pokémon or a Pokedex, that's okay! A Pokedex is a make-believe device from the Pokémon universe that allows you to look up information about Pokémon—such as their names, types, and stats.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface
- Look up Pokémon by name or ID
- View Pokémon types, stats, and more
- Uses live data from the PokéAPI

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Pokedex:**

   ```

3. **Use commands like:**
   - `help` — Show available commands
